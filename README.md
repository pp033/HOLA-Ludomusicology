# HOLA: Team Ludomusicology

This game was developed in the course of "HOLA Serious Games", organized by the MFG Baden WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany.
The challenge was to make a game that playfully teaches students the added value and purposeful use of music in video games.

"Meowlody" is a 2D platformer / sidescroller / autoscroller. 
The game is playable on a Windows PC and with keyboard control.

The player controls the main character, a cute cat, through various levels. Each level is characterised by music and graphics which resemble a certain musical style. The core element of the game is the platforms on which the cat can move, as they are the visualised sound tracks of the audible music. By collecting various items, the player can influence the music - and thus also the platforms and other aspects of the game world - in order to collect as many notes as possible and beat their own score. But most importantly, the player is encouraged to explore and experiment by becoming the conductor of their own game music.

The game was realised in the Unity Engine.
